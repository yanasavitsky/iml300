[the forager](https://yanasavitsky.github.io/iml300/project-1/index.html) is an interactive web experience created by Yana Savitsky, journeying through the loss of a grandfather.

### Description

A few months ago, my grandpa passed away in Belarus â€” all alone. Due to rising COVID cases and political protests within Belarus, I couldn't visit him or even attend his funeral. The forager attempts to help me heal and process my grandfather's death through a fragmented narrative. Viewers traverse through immersive nature and audio elements, alongside pictures of myself from when I was younger. I also wrote verses to go alongside the visuals, making the viewer feel absorbed in the story. The hyper narrative was coded in HTML and CSS, while the imagery was either my own or found online.
