        So, when I came to write science-fiction novels, I came lugging this
        great heavy sack of stuff, my carrier bag full of wimps and klutzes, and
        tiny grains of things smaller than a mustard seed, and intricately woven
        nets which when laboriously unknotted are seen to contain one blue
        pebble, an imperturbably functioning chronometer telling the time on
        another world, and a mouse’s skull; full of beginnings without ends, of
        initiations, of losses, of transformations and translations, and far
        more tricks than conflicts, far fewer triumphs than snares and
        delusions; full of space ships that get stuck, missions that fail, and
        people who don’t understand. I said it was hard to make a gripping tale
        of how we wrested the wild oats from their husks, I didn’t say it was
        impossible. Who ever said writing a novel was easy?
