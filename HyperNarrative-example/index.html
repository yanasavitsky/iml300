          If it is a human thing to do to put something you want, because it’s
          useful, edible, or beautiful, into a bag<img
            class="emoji"
            src="asset/bag.png"
          />, or a basket<img class="emoji" src="asset/basket.png" />, or a bit
          of rolled bark or leaf, or a net woven of your own hair, or what have
          you, and then take it home with you,
        </p>

        <p>
          home being another, larger kind of pouch or bag, a container for
          people, and then later on you take it out and
          <a href="#fourth-paragraph">eat it</a> or
          <a href="page-2.html">share it</a> or
          <a href="page-3.html">store it</a> up for winter in a solider
          container or put it in the medicine bundle or the shrine or the
          museum, the holy place, the area that contains what is sacred, and
          then next day you probably do much the same again — if to do that is
          human, if that’s what it takes, then I am a human being after all.
          Fully, freely, gladly, for the first time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Not, let it be said at once, an unaggressive or uncombative human
          being. I am an aging, angry woman laying mightily about me with my
          handbag, fighting hoodlums off. However I don’t, nor does anybody
          else, consider myself heroic for doing so. It’s just one of those
          damned things you have to do in order to be able to go on gathering
          wild oats and telling stories.
        </p>

        <p id="fourth-paragraph">
          It is hard to tell a really gripping tale of how I wrestled a wild-oat
          seed from its husk, and then another, and then another, and then
          another, and then another, and then I scratched my gnat bites, and Ool
          said something funny, and we went to the creek and got a drink and
          watched newts for a while, and then I found another patch of oats....
          No, it does not compare, it cannot compete with how I thrust my spear
          deep into the titanic hairy flank while Oob, impaled on one huge
          sweeping tusk, writhed screaming, and blood sprouted everywhere in
          crimson torrents, and Boob was crushed to jelly when the mammoth fell
          on him as I shot my unerring arrow straight through eye to brain.
